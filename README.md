# Physical-Teachable-Machine-v2.0
### Physical Computing + Machine Learning resources
---
#### An updated repo of Arduino and P5JS resources for teaching machine learning with physical computing tools.<br>  

These resources build on from the [Creative ML repo](https://github.com/j3nsykes/creativeML2020), streamlining the examples and adding further resources that compliment existing developments in Tensorflow Lite models. 

***
Each example has an accompanying Arduino .ino sketch to make sure the serial data is parsed to P5JS correctly. The P5JS sketches utilise web serial and are ***only compatible with Chrome***.  
Make sure to turn on the [WebSerial API in Chrome](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-serial/)<br>
